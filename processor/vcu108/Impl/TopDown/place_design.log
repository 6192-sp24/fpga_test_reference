INFO: [DRC PORTPROP-10] Incorrect IOStandard on MCAP reset: The PCI Express reset pin RST_N_pci_sys_reset_n is driven by an IOB with a 1.8V IO standard.  This is incompatible with the 3.3V signal that is generated by the reset pin of the PCI Express edge connector.  Your  design will require an external level shifter to convert the incoming 3.3V reset signal from the edge connector to the 1.8V at the FPGA pin.
